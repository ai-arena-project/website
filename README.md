# AI Arena Website

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd aiarena-website
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

## Development

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

The development server uses Turbopack for faster builds and refreshes.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
# or
bun build
```

### Running in Production

To start the production server after building:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
# or
bun start
```

The production server will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default. You can configure the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

## Additional Commands
